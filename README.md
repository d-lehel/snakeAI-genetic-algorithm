# Snake AI with Genetic Algorithm

Description:
This project implements a snake game in Pygame with a twist - the snake is controlled by an AI agent trained using a genetic algorithm. The goal is for the snake to collect as much food as possible while avoiding crashing into walls or its own body.

The genetic algorithm works by evolving a population of candidate AI agents over multiple generations. Each agent's fitness is evaluated based on its performance in the game, and the fittest individuals are selected to produce offspring for the next generation. Through this process of selection, crossover, and mutation, the AI gradually learns to navigate the game more effectively.

The project is implemented in Python, using the Pygame library for graphics and user input. The genetic algorithm is implemented from scratch, using basic concepts of population genetics.
